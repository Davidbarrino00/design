## Overview

The select panel allows you to select one or multiple items from a list, and it can be enhanced with additional controls like a search input to expedite the selection process. It is often used to augment information of a wide variety of items.

For instance, you may encounter a select panel when you need to assign someone to a task or add labels to an issue or pull request. It can also be utilized to select a specific branch in a code repository.

It's important to understand the differences between the select panel and [action menu](action-menu). The primary distinction lies in the fact that an action menu lacks the ability to include additional form controls and automatically closes after making a selection. Therefore, if you require a filterable list or the capability to make multiple selections at once, the select panel is the appropriate choice.

## Anatomy

  alt="Select panel for assigning labels to an issue. 'Apply labels to this issue' heading, close button in upper right hand corner. Search input with a magnifer icon as a visible label, listbox of label options and the first three are selected with a visual checkbox. The footer contains a button to edit labels, and cancel and apply buttons. Purple labels are overlayed onto select panel: Overlay (dialog) pointing to the container, Search input pointing to the input, role='listbox' bracket of the listbox content, Optional action control to the button in the lower left corner, Explicit confirm / submission buttons bracket for the apply and cancel buttons in the lower right corner."

/>

The select panel is composed of three main areas: a header, a scrollable list, and an optional footer.

- **Header:** The header always includes a title and a close button. Additionally, it can have an optional search/filter field to find items quicker. When a selection is made, a "clear all" button should also be present.
- **List (scrollable):** The scrollable list consists of [action list](/components/action-list) items, which can be either single or multi-select options.
- **Footer (Optional):** In most cases, especially in multi-select scenarios, the select panel includes a footer that incorporates a "Cancel" and an "Apply" button also refered to as declaritive actions. If any additional controls are required, such as an extra checkbox or button, a footer becomes necessary as well.

## Options

The select panel provides flexibility by offering both simple list-based single selection and multi-selection options. Additionally, it can become more sophisticated by incorporating advanced features such as filtering functionality and the inclusion of links.

<img
  width="960"
  alt="First select panel is a branch switcher control that includes tabs, a search input, a listbox with single-select items, and a footer with an All branches link, and cancel and apply buttons. Second select panel is titled 'Show fields, with a list of about 10 multi-select items and apply and cancel buttons in the footer."

### Trigger

<img src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/5960fd74-1ec2-45fc-a4e9-21421e6ab26e" alt="" />

Select panels can be activated by either a regular button or an icon button. If the button is intended to represent the current selection, it's crucial to have a label associated with it, either internally (within the button) or externally (adjacent to the button).

### List (single select)

<img
  width="960"
  alt="Multi-select"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/3d0cc2b5-b958-4b62-805e-f77a9d7bf0d9"
/>

If the select panel doesn't have an additional checkbox in the footer, you can make an instant selection. This means that the select panel will close as soon as you make the selection.

However, if there is an additional form element required for that selection, such as checking an additional option, it is necessary to have a cancel and confirmation button. This prevents the dialog from unexpectedly closing when you click an option, allowing you to review and confirm your selection.

To indicate an instant selection, we use checkmarks to show the selected option. For regular single selects, we use visually styled radio buttons. Note they are not semantically radio buttons.

### List (multi select)

<img
  width="960"
  alt="Multi-select"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/33176d07-2853-4318-bf5d-df395e700fa9"
/>

The multi-select list allows you to choose multiple items from a list and has additional features like `select all` or `indeterminate selections`.

The `select all` option at the top of the list allows for quickly deselecting or selecting all values
however when you seperate items in groups this option isn't available anymore.

It also can only be used when all available options can be returned. For example if the list is too large to retrieve all options at once,
such as when using API endpoints with limited results then this feature may not be suitable.
We should refrain from putting a strain on API endpoints to return all the possible results at once as this could result in a performance downgrade in a scenario of large lists since virtualization is currently not built into this component.

The `intermediate selections` option is useful for performing bulk actions on lists. For example, if you have 20 selected items, but some of them have different labels attached, an indeterminate checkbox (represented by a horizontal line) is shown for labels that are not set on all items.

### Footer

<img

  alt="Footers"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/85bcb93b-3d39-4635-ad1b-68243dae6bd9"
/>

The optional footer at the bottom could include a single link, button or
checkbox to take additional actions.

In case of a multi selection we always recommend a `cancel` and `apply` button as well unless you clearly [understand the accessibility implications](#cancelsubmit) of not adding this.

### Error/Warning

<img
  width="1466"
  alt="Error"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/135d597a-33cd-4ba1-a86b-241a1b5bdfcb"
/>

Sometimes, we encounter situations where things don't work as expected, or we need to inform users about something important. There are various ways to handle these scenarios depending on the situation.

For instance, if the default values fail to load initially, we display an error placeholder to let the user know that something went wrong.

When the initial values are loaded and the user performs a search for new values, there may be instances where the search fails. In such cases, it is essential to ensure that the user can still make a selection without losing their current selection. Instead, we display an error message at the top of the list, notifying the user about the search failure while preserving their ability to continue with their selection process.

For errors we should always include a link to our support page to ensure that users have a way to reach out to us for assistance.

### Cancel/submit

In most scenarios, we recommend using declarative controls, except for single-select options as mentioned earlier. However, we understand that in certain areas of the product, using declarative controls can slow down daily actions. For example, if the issue creation process involves too many steps, it may discourage customers from reporting issues.

To address this challenge, we are actively working on providing guidance on how to navigate this friction while providing the best accessible experience possible.

Before we determine whether we need cancel/submit buttons in the footer of the select panel, let's first understand the distinction between passive and active selections.

Passive selections occur when the select panel doesn't immediately save the selected data to a database. In other words, the selection is temporary and not submitted right away. An example of this is a form that asks you to pick your top 5 favorite people and write a message for them in a seperate `textarea`, this form isn't submitted after picking your favorite people but only once your click `Send`.

On the other hand, active selections involve immediate data writing to the database upon making a selection or closing the select panel dialog. It's important to be cautious with active selections to avoid triggering unintended workflows or creating interactions without explicit confirmation from the user. For instance, accidentally assigning an issue to the wrong user who then receives a notification. This is particularly important for users with accessibility needs who may make unintended selections more easily. To prevent such issues, it's necessary to provide a cancel and apply button, allowing users to review and confirm their choices.

**Examples of passive selections:**

- Switching branches in a code repository
- Selections within a form
- Filtering a view

**Examples of active selections:**

- Adding labels to an pull request
- Assigning users to an issue
- Sending invites

In passive selections the cancel/submit button could be avoided but in active selections we need to treat carefully and consider if the action that was taken is easily revertable.
By understanding these differences, the select panel respects user intentions, avoids unintended actions, and minimizes frustrations, especially for users with accessibility requirements.

### Loading

It is important to provide visual cues to the user when certain processes may take longer than expected. Loading states can be utilized at different stages of using this component to communicate this information effectively.

<img
  width="1668"
  alt="First select panel is a branch switcher control that includes tabs, a search input, a listbox with single-select items, and a footer with an All branches link, and cancel and apply buttons. Second select panel is titled 'Show fields, with a list of about 10 multi-select items and apply and cancel buttons in the footer."
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/f9f118f3-5830-4ce6-8981-5ea7afd56894"
/>

1. **Initial**: This loading state is used when retrieving the initial data to prevent users from seeing an empty list. Skeleton loaders can be used if the data is expected to arrive within 500 milliseconds.
2. **Searching/Filtering**: When users perform a search to fetch new items, it is important to maintain their current selections or allow them to continue making selections. In this case, a more minimal loading state should be used to indicate ongoing activity.
3. **Confirmation**: If your layout does not incorporate optimistic updates or lacks error messaging for failed updates, it is crucial to use a confirmation button as a loading state to clearly communicate the progress of the update.

By employing these loading states, users can have a better understanding of the process and remain informed throughout their interactions with the component.

### Limit selections

<img
  width="960"
  alt="First select panel is a branch switcher control that includes tabs, a search input, a listbox with single-select items, and a footer with an All branches link, and cancel and apply buttons. Second select panel is titled 'Show fields, with a list of about 10 multi-select items and apply and cancel buttons in the footer."
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/9cacdd30-99b3-4571-b37f-3066b7219ab2"
/>

In certain situations, we may need to restrict the number of items a user can select, either due to infrastructure limitations or limitations based on paid features. It is important to inform the user about this restriction before they begin making their selection. The description can be used effectively to communicate this limitation.

When the user reaches the maximum allowed number of selections, we need to display a warning message indicating that they have reached their limit. This can also be an opportunity to provide a link for upgrading their account if the restriction is related to a paid feature. It is worth noting that the warning message is labeled with an `aria-live` attribute, ensuring that users with screen readers receive a notification when the message appears.

### Search/Filtering

Including a search or filter input field not only accelerates the selection process for users but also prevents the need to burden the browser or API endpoints with returning extensive lists of items.

    <Caption>Don’t place the search/filter input in the scrollable area.</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

Adopting a smart approach of returning a limited number of items at a time can significantly enhance speed and potentially eliminate the necessity for searching altogether. For instance, instead of presenting the first 20 labels in alphabetical order, providing the most commonly used labels can be more effective. This strategic implementation optimizes the selection process and improves user experience.

### Items

Select panels are designed to be lightweight and should not be overloaded with excessive information. For instance, when using a user picker, it is often sufficient to include essential details such as the username, full name, and avatar. Less relevant information, such as the total number of followers or location, can be omitted as it is not as crucial for the selection process.

</DoDontContainer>

Items accompanied by a checkmark icon, as opposed to radio buttons or checkboxes, indicate that the selection panel will automatically close upon making a choice. Therefore, they cannot be used in conjunction with declarative buttons.

When an additional checkbox is added to the footer, declarative buttons are required, and the items should be accompanied by visually resembling radio buttons. Although they are not technically radio buttons in terms of semantics, using visual radio buttons can effectively convey that the selection process is not yet complete even after making a choice.

### Responsive

On smaller breakpoints the select panel could become either a full screen dialog or a bottom sheet dialog.
The confirmations buttons and action list items also are changed to medium to ensure that the hit target is large enough for touch devices.

When including an additional action in the footer also make sure that this still fit on a 320px viewport.
